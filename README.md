# Book An Artist - Senior Software Engineer Assignment


## React to-do app challenge

This assignment is designed to give you an idea of the work you'll be facing day-to-day in this role, whilst even providing you with the opportunity to showcase your skillset and thought process.

We hope you find this exercise challenging but enjoyable. 

The to-do application is intentionally broken, and there are few issues that you need to fix:

1. Fix the app to display list of all tasks.
2. Fix the layout such that the checkboxes should be listed in a column.
3. Fix the app to add a new task.
4. Fix the app to mark a task as completed.
5. Fix the app to delete a task.
6. Fix the app to count the completed tasks.


## Bonus Points

- Searching/filtering the data in the list
- List pagination if greater than 10 items or lazy-load
- Write tests cases where possible
- Additional views

## Get started

To get started with the challenge, clone this repository, install the dependencies and run the app using the following commands.
